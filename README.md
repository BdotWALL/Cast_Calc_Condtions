Cast_Calc_Condtions

Casting
1. Create two variables. One variable should have a data type of double and the other one should have a data type of int. Set the double variable equal to 112.35 and set the in value to the double variable. You must explicitly cast your double into an in for the second variable. Please print them both to the console to match the below output.

2. Create two more variables. One variable should be a string variable that is equal to the number 49. Create another variable with the data type of int. The second variable should be equal to the first variable and cast using the parseInt() method. Please print them both to the console to match the below output.

Calculations
Create a class called "Calculations" that reads user input of two numbers and prints the result of calculating with the two numbers. You will need to print 5 lines with results for the following calculations (use all 5 arithmetic operators): Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus

Conditional Statements
1. BoilingWater
Create a class called "BoilingWater" that accepts user input asking for a number greater than 212. Write a conditional statement that writes that the "Water is boiling!" if the number entered is greater than 212.

2.NumberComparison
Create a class called "NumberComparison" that accepts user input asking for two numbers. Use all three conditional statements (if, else if, and else) to output one of the three statements depending on what the two numbers are. 

--Same: Numbers are the same
--Number one is larger than number two: The first number was larger than the second
--Number two is larger than number one: The second number was larger than the first

3.TestScores
Create a class called "TestScores" that accepts user input asking for a number between 0 and 100. Depending on what the number is, return a statement telling the user what score they got on a test using a 10 point grading scale. For example, if the user enters 73, then the program should return "Your grade is a C."

4.SameOrNah
Create a class called "SameOrNah" that accepts user input asking for two words. Write a conditional statement that writes that the "The words are the same" if the strings match or it writes "The words are different" if the strings do not match.
